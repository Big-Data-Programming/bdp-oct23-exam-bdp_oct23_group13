Problem Statement

Doodle, a well-known software company, has historically depended on external

recruitment agencies to identify top talent in the market. Currently, they aim to

automate this procedure by developing an internal solution that identifies and

selects potential candidates for roles such as developers, senior developers,

and solution architects by analyzing various online data points.
