**User Stories:**

**HR Manager:**

As an HR manager, after I receive the requirements for a candidate from the recruiting manager,

I want the system to automatically to filter candidates based on essential criteria like education,

experience, and specific skills from sites like GitHub, Stack Overflow and LinkedIn, so that I can

quickly identify the most qualified candidates for the position relying on a scoring system that

evaluates each candidate based on various metrics related to their profile. I also desire a

system that offers the convenience of dispatching emails to candidates containing the link for

the online coding test which is active for a finite period, achievable through a simple button click.

Additionally, I want the system to ensure the algorithm is not deterministic to prevent replication

discussions. I would like the system to have the capability to schedule interviews between the

recruiting manager and the candidate, should the candidate advance to the next round.

Additionally, I also wish to have a dashboard that constantly updates me on the progress and

status of the candidates.

**Recruiting Manager:**

As a recruiting manager, I am looking for a system that allows me to effortlessly send candidate

requirements to the HR manager using the fewest possible clicks. I also wish for the system to

automatically assess the candidates' performance in the online coding test, offering me detailed

insights into their coding abilities. Furthermore, I would like the system to be capable of sending

comprehensive feedback on the performance directly to the candidate. Additionally, I am

interested in having a dashboard that displays the performance of all candidates who have

participated in the online coding test, equipped with filtering capabilities.

**Candidate:**

As a candidate, I anticipate the online coding platform to be versatile, allowing coding in various

languages. I also expect the system to be user-friendly and reliably stable, preventing crashes

throughout the test duration. I need to be able to check the status of my application in real-time,

so that I am constantly informed about where I stand in the recruitment process. I would also

like to receive constructive feedback if my performance in the recruitment process is not

successful, so that I can understand areas for improvement for future applications. Additionally, I

need the system to offer flexible interview scheduling options, so that I can choose a time that

fits my schedule without back-and-forth communication.
